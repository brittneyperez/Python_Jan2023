-- Learning SQL Queries with Twitter Database

-- Let's see what's in each table:
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM faves;
SELECT * FROM follows;
SELECT * FROM tweets;

-- SELECT Basics
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users;

-- SELECT w/ Conditionals
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id >= 3;
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1 OR id=2 ORDER BY birthday DESC; -- recent yr to former yrs

-- Get the last names of users with id of 2 or 3
SELECT last_name FROM users WHERE id = 2 OR id = 3;
-- Get all users with id above 2
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id > 2;
-- Get all users with first names ending in "e"
SELECT * FROM users WHERE first_name LIKE "%e";
-- Get all users with first names starting with "K"
SELECT * FROM users WHERE first_name LIKE "K%";
-- Get all users with first names NOT starting with "K"
SELECT * FROM users WHERE first_name NOT LIKE "K%";

-- SELECT w/ Sorting
-- Get all of the youngest users at the top of the table
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY birthday DESC;
-- Get all of the oldest users at the top of the table
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY birthday ASC;
-- Get all users with the first name that ends with "e" and with the youngest users at the top of the table
SELECT * FROM users WHERE first_name LIKE "%e" ORDER BY birthday DESC;
-- Get only the first names of all users in alphabetical order
SELECT first_name FROM users ORDER BY first_name;

-- SELECT w/ LIMIT and OFFSET
-- Get the first 3 users
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 3;
-- Get user records 3-5
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2;
-- Combine LIMIT & OFFSET (provides the same result as before)
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 2,3;


-- INSERTING --
-- INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name, handle, birthday) VALUES ("Jane", "Doe", "janedoe", "1999-03-23");
INSERT INTO tweets (tweet, user_id, created_at, updated_at) VALUES ("Hello World!", 6, NOW(), NOW());
INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name, handle, birthday, created_at, updated_at) VALUES ("Delete", "Test", "delete_test", "2000-01-01", NOW(), NOW());
INSERT INTO tweets (tweet, user_id, created_at, updated_at) VALUES ("DELETE Everything!", 7, NOW(), NOW());


-- UPDATE --
UPDATE users SET created_at=NOW(), updated_at=NOW() WHERE id=6;


-- DELETE --
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
DELETE FROM users WHERE id=7;
DELETE FROM tweets WHERE id=14;
