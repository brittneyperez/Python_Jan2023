# Friendships

### Synopsis

Imagine that you're a developer working at a social media startup, and you've been asked to create an ERD containing different users, and keeping track of their "friends" on the platform.


**Your Task**: Create an ERD to represent the database for an application that tracks users and their friends.

Each user should have an `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `created_at` and `updated_at`. Create a self join relationship (many to many to same table), where a user can have a friend (another user from the same table). Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this diagram.
