# Users ERD

### Synopsis

Nearly all applications have users, so practicing setting up an ERD to represent them within a database is a valuable exercise!


**Your Task**: Create an ERD to represent the database for an application that track users.

Each user should have an `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `created_at` and `updated_at`. Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this diagram.
