# Event Planner

### Synopsis

Create an ERD to represent the database for an application that allows users to plan events and rsvp to others' events.

Each event should have a `title`, a `description`, `location`, a `start_time`, and an `end_time`. Each user should have a name and an address. Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this diagram.
